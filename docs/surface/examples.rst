Examples
========

This section contains examples of using the SurfaceGrid class for various applications.

3D Island Generation
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Example code for generating a 3D island will be added here
   # This will demonstrate:
   # - Creating a spherical grid
   # - Applying noise for terrain generation
   # - Visualizing the result in 3D

3D Planet Generation
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Example code for generating a 3D planet will be added here
   # This will demonstrate:
   # - Creating a spherical grid
   # - Applying multiple noise layers for terrain and atmosphere
   # - Visualizing the result in 3D with custom lighting
